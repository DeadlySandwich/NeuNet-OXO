# NeuNet-OXO
Program to teach and test a Neural Network to play tic tac toe, in Python!

This is the source code for my Computing A-Level COMP4 Project.

In its current state there is no GUI; the only graphics are the generated pie-charts at the end.

To use, I recommend Anaconda Spyder with Python 2.7.8. See Requirements.txt

There is a problem with the optimization routine. The program still runs as expected, but every iteration/step of the basinhopping routine prints "warning: basinhopping: local minimization failure". I am not sure whether this is a contributing factor to its very, very long run time.
